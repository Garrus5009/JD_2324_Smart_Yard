The Enclosure Lid.stl file contains the TinkerCAD model for the enclosure lid, which has a place on top for a small solar panel to sit.

The Mighty Habbi.stl file contains the TinkerCAD model for the main part of the enclosure that houses the board, most wires, the power supplies, and the DHT-22 and Ultrasonic sensors.

The wirehousing.stl file contains the TinkerCAD model for the body of the stake, which gives room for wires coming from the Mighty Habbi structure to run to the sensors located in the ground-stake portion of the enclosure.

The ground-stake.stl file contains the TinkerCAD model for the portion of the stake that goes into the ground; This contains the Rain Water Level sensor as well as the Soil Moisture sensor.

We would recommend that if using this enclosure for a future project, you place the stake in a 'plot of land' that's deeper than 4-6 inches. If the design is still too top-heavy to be stable enough when placed at safe level, then a redesign may be in order.

Our design did not account for heat management of the boards, which may be important as oftentimes, the Raspberry Pi boards can run hot. May need to improve the design with heat management in mind, whether thats making room in the main enclosure to add a fan to the Raspberry Pi board, or adding 
ventilation (while maintaining water-resistance standards), will be up to you.
