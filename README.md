# JD_2324_Smart_Yard
Repo for code used in communication infrastructure for an IoT Yard solution

The Type-B and Type-C code files in the main directory are the versions that have the attempts at getting the BLE communication between the Type-C and Type-B devices working.

The Actual_TB_and_TC_Code folder contains the versions of the Type-A, Type-B, and Type-C code files used in our presentation at John Deere in Cary.

The Enclosure folder contains the TinkerCAD models for the different parts of the enclosure used for our presentation at John Deere.
